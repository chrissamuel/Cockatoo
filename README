This is the Cockatoo AR.Drone program by Andy Gelme.

README by Chris Samuel based on what I can gather from the source. :-)

The Cockatoo proxy connects to an AR.Drone 1 (currently) on the default
IP address of 192.168.1.1 and sends it UDP commands to control it.

When the proxy starts it sets up a TCP port listening for connections on
5600 and accepts commands in plain text.

Currently those commands are:

takeoff
land
forward <repeat>
backward (possibly with a <repeat> argument)


To compile:

$ make


To run:
$ java Cockatoo


To clean:

$ make clean
